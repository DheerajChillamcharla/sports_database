# DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF SPORTS DATABASE

Problem Statement:
The database aims to create two or more teams with player entries in each team in order to compute the results of (simulated) matches between these teams based on goals scored by each team in their respective matches. The database will contain player details, positions, teams, ratings, matches, staff and the details which are required for matches to take place. In addition to the above-mentioned columns, we would also compute stat ratings and roles of the players in all the created teams using existing data.
